            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Due to the nature of SCP-152141155141154, conventional containment is impossible. Current protocols focus on global observation, data suppression, and preemptive mitigation of its anomalous effects. Foundation assets embedded within global communication networks are to continuously monitor for emergent fractal patterns or self-replicating information cascades indicative of SCP-152141155141154's influence.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Any media or digital content exhibiting signs of fractal self-similarity beyond statistical norms, or possessing memetic properties that encourage its rapid, uncontrolled dissemination, is to be immediately quarantined and purged. Public awareness of SCP-152141155141154's existence, or even the abstract concept of its anomalous properties, must be prevented at all costs.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Mobile Task Force Gamma-13 ("Asimov's Lawbringers") is tasked with the development and deployment of counter-memetic agents and digital deterrents designed to disrupt SCP-152141155141154's propagation. All personnel interacting with data potentially influenced by SCP-152141155141154 are to undergo weekly psychological evaluations and memetic inoculation procedures.

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                SCP-152141155141154 is a conceptual anomaly that manifests as an infinitely recursive, self-replicating information construct. It lacks a physical form, existing purely as a pattern of data and ideas that, once perceived or understood, compels its host to reproduce and disseminate it. The anomaly's "true" form is hypothesized to be a hyper-dimensional fractal, the full comprehension of which is believed to be beyond human cognitive capacity and would result in immediate, catastrophic memetic contamination.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Its effects are primarily memetic and cognitohazardous, influencing information systems and biological minds to propagate its underlying fractal structure. This propagation often occurs through seemingly innocuous means, such as viral videos, chain emails, abstract art, or even specific sequences of numbers or sounds. The more a host attempts to analyze or understand SCP-152141155141154, the deeper the memetic infection becomes, leading to increasingly obsessive behavior and a heightened compulsion to spread the anomaly.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                The "Apollyon" classification stems from its theoretical Omega-class scenario: a global, irreversible memetic infection leading to the complete collapse of all organized thought and societal structures, as humanity becomes a collective, unwitting vector for SCP-152141155141154's endless replication.

            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 border-b border-gray-700 pb-2">Addendum 152141155141154-A: Incident Log 001</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                On [REDACTED], a localized memetic outbreak occurred within a popular online forum after a user posted a seemingly innocuous image file. Within hours, thousands of users reported experiencing mild cognitive dissonance, followed by an inexplicable urge to share the image and create similar content. MTF Gamma-13 was deployed, successfully quarantining the affected data and administering Class-C amnestics to exposed individuals. Post-incident analysis revealed the image contained subtle, infinitely repeating patterns at the sub-pixel level, consistent with SCP-152141155141154's influence.

                <span class="text-red-400 font-bold">[O5-COMMAND DIRECTIVE]:</span> All digital assets, regardless of perceived threat level, must undergo rigorous fractal and memetic pattern analysis before public release or internal Foundation distribution. The risk of even minor exposure is deemed unacceptable.
